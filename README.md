# Gmail API Helper
*A nice function that let's you extract the data you need from a Message instance of the Gmail API*

When you get a Message from the Gmail API, it looks pretty ugly and it's hard to get the name and email from the sender and receiver(s).

This function makes it easy. We're using it at [Nat.app](https://nat.app). Hopefully it will help others that are using the Gmail API!
